Opinions expressed are those of the author. | Membership (fee-based) Aug 29, 2022, 08:15am EDT Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin When you're responsible for creating new business opportunities that will attract potential clients and keep the current ones engaged, it's not always easy to determine which of the latest business solutions to take seriously for investment and which ones to leave on the shelf.\n",
            "Nevertheless, finding the right mix of the latest products and services will contribute to the vast amount of career advancement options in various fields and across regional locations, as companies onboard skilled individuals to achieve the overall mission and drive success for the business.\n",
            "Below, 14 Forbes Business Development Council members weigh in on the hottest industry trends that early (and seasoned) business professionals should be considering and why.\n",
            "Forbes Business Development Council members weigh in. Photos courtesy of individual members.\n",
            "1. Fractional C-Suite Services\n",
            "Fractional C-suite services are a red hot emerging trend right now! For instance, a tech startup seeking its first seed round of funding and needing help with financial models, valuations, financial planning and analysis would greatly benefit from hiring a fractional CFO at a much lower cost than retaining one for a larger sum of money while still only in its beginning stages. - Manny Reyna , Consultarian\n",
            "2. AI, Augmented and Virtual Reality And Biotechnology\n",
            "Artificial intelligence, augmented and virtual reality and biotechnology are good choices for those who are new to business development and looking at what field to get started in. These technologies are in demand now and offer many decades of career opportunities across multiple industries and geographies. - Serrah Linares , Change Healthcare\n",
            "3. Retail Media Networks\n",
            "In the world of digital marketing and adtech, retail media networks (RMNs) will explode. It is forecasted to be a lucrative industry in the next three years, so you will see a flood of media budgets pouring into RMNs. The biggest retailers are building them, ad agencies are pushing dollars into them and brands are trying to leverage them. The connection to high-quality data that is actionable has a massive draw! - Adam Herman , Goodway Group\n",
            "4. Fintech Platforms\n",
            "Prior to the pandemic, there were large segments of the population that were uncomfortable engaging in online financial transactions. Throughout the pandemic, individuals were forced into transacting online, But the experience created comfort and trust in online finance management. This opened up massive markets that were previously closed off, allowing for greater innovation and disruption in a welcoming environment. - Mark Cerminaro , RAPID FINANCE\n",
            "Forbes Business Development Council is an invitation-only community for sales and biz dev executives. Do I qualify?\n",
            "5. Software As A Service\n",
            "Given that the world is heading towards an economic downturn, every company will be thinking about gaining efficiencies and getting more from their resources. The SaaS space (software as a service) will therefore be huge. The AI and machine learning element of SaaS can support staff by leveraging intelligent software solution features that can take care of tasks that are more tactical. - Javed Laher , Mediaocean\n",
            "6. Cybersecurity\n",
            "Anything related to cybersecurity is one of the hottest industries out there right now. More remote workers make this a critical issue since it increases the potential attack surface. In addition, rising ransomware threats and a continual onslaught of data breaches are issues facing companies today. The need is great, the landscape is crowded and many startups in this space are getting funded. - Julie Thomas , ValueSelling Associates\n",
            "7. Digital Audio\n",
            "Digital audio has the advantage of a unique combination: the emergence of new industries, such as podcasts, connected car and home, voice commerce and more coupled with the “digitization” of a scaled, existing industry like radio. It’s similar to digital video when new formats like YouTube and social media forced traditional TV to adjust. The potential digital audio creates for new business is enormous. - Paul Kelly , A Million Ads\n",
            "8. Preserving The Human Experience\n",
            "While there are endless innovations coming up, what is dying is the human experience. When going digital, businesses and consumers are paying for human experiences, local support and services and personalization. Business developers should consider factoring these into their proposals. - Zeenath Kuraisha , Asia Pacific Sales & Marketing Academy Pte Ltd\n",
            "9. Education Technology\n",
            "Edtech is essential. Businesses need talented and skilled individuals to stay innovative and competitive. However, shorter innovation cycles and rapid technological change are widening the digital skills gap. Education technology can help people gain the skills needed to thrive in an ever-changing global economy, thereby providing rewarding lifelong career opportunities to business development professionals. - Chor Meng Tan , Wiley\n",
            "10. Healthcare Services\n",
            "Healthcare is one industry that is coming forward and disrupting the market post-Covid-19. Consumers have become highly conscious about their health, and the industry understands the growing need to stay healthy. Businesses are capitalizing on the personalized healthcare wave by offering healthcare services to enhance care quality, optimize access, improve safety and champion the patient experience. - Ashu Goel , WinWire\n",
            "11. Clean, Blue And Green Technologies\n",
            "In addition to cybersecurity and robotics, clean, blue and green technologies are the businesses and sectors that are rapidly maturing in these areas. This means they are well funded and looking for go-to-market strategies and for the sales teams to make those inroads. It's also a space that offers business development execs many opportunities to bring goods and services to market that will help, not hurt, the world. - Jonathan Mills , EPIC Strategies\n",
            "12. Advertising Technology\n",
            "In the flurry of messages that reach audiences daily, it is crucial to tailor a brand's message to its target audience and make it stand out. The adtech industry creates mechanizations that make it possible for brands to reach who they want and optimize their advertising efforts and budgets. That is why brands need to be on the cutting edge in order to make their mark in the business landscape. - Anna Jankowska , RTB House\n",
            "13. Food Supply Chain Solutions\n",
            "Intelligent food supply chain solutions are crucial. War, inflation and fuel prices notwithstanding, managing global food supply chains will become a challenge for the future as some economies deal with waste and others navigate mass starvation. The debate surrounding GMO and organic will continue to grow. Business development professionals should get a leg up before this industry heats up. - Wajid Mirza , Arthur Lawrence\n",
            "14. Consulting Services\n",
            "There are many reasons why consulting services are in high demand. For starters, the global pandemic, geopolitical situation and supply chain management issues have altered the way business is done over the past two years. Organizations are forced to keep up with the changing times and need support on what they do not know. Leaders are expected to focus on outcome-driven decision-making practices. Therefore, stakeholders need advice on reaching these outcomes instead of engaging in their previous processes. - Mustansir Paliwala , EQUANS\n",

            "Article by¬† Tom Wright ¬†¬†‚Äî ¬†Published¬† December 22, 2022 August 19, 2023 So far, we've written about how to create the perfect vision statement , as well as a set of great company values . Now we're going to show you how to start creating your actual strategic plan - starting with creating strategic focus areas. This article is part of our mini series 'How To Write A Strategic Plan'. You can download our free 'How To Write A Strategic Plan' eBook which contains all of the articles from the series. ‚Äç You can find the individual articles below: How To Write A Strategic Plan: The Cascade Model How to Write a Good Vision Statement How To Create Company Values Creating Strategic Focus Areas (This Article) How To Write Strategic Objectives How To Create Effective Projects How To Write KPIs What is a strategic focus area? Focus areas are¬† the foundation stones of your strategy . They expand on your Vision Statement and start to create some structure around how to actually get your organization to achieve its goals. Focus area meaning¬† Stay focused on delivering your vision, it's now time to move on to the specifics of our plan, starting with how to create strategic focus areas. As always, we'll start with a quick refresher on how our complete strategic plan will look: ¬† In past articles, we've used the example of a bike manufacturer to illustrate aspects of a solid strategic plan - we'll continue that theme here. To recap: Our Vision: ‚ÄúTo be the premier bike manufacturer in the Pacific Northwest.\" Our Values: Innovative Passionate Accountability Compassionate Our Focus Areas: Aggressive Growth Nation's Best Bikes Modern Manufacturer Top Places To Work A common question we receive from organizations using our cloud system Cascade is ' How many Focus Areas should we create '? The answer is in the question. How many things can you and your people realistically focus on at one time? In our experience, 3 to 6 is probably a reasonable range. Focus Areas should be easy enough to remember so that any employee you bump into in a corridor should be able to easily recap them. Any more than 6 Focus Areas runs the risk of you being, well....unfocused! One of the hardest things about creating strategic focus areas for your organization is deciding what to leave out. You probably have a thousand things that you want to achieve, but one of the key outcomes of this process is to refine these things down to those that really matter in the here and now for your organization. The rule is, if an activity does not fit into one of your focus areas - it shouldn't be happening - at least not right now. Sure there may be 'emergency exceptions' here and there - but it's important to commit to the process of refinement wholeheartedly, so spend enough time creating your focus areas to ensure they cover the gambit of everything you want to achieve. Creating strategic focus areas To help you while creating strategic focus areas, we've devised the following checklist that by-and-large, all your focus areas should conform to: 1) No longer than 6 words each Long winded strategic focus areas are an oxymoron - if you can't distill your focus into 6 words or less, keep refining it until you can - it needs to be simple and memorable. 2) Not too broad Don't cheat by creating strategic focus areas that are too broad, like 'Be profitable'. Unless this really is a specific focus (e.g. for new startups) - this defeats the point of the exercise and doesn't help you to focus at all! 3) No jargon Avoid ambiguous terms like 'maximize' or 'succeed' - state what you are trying to achieve as an outcome, not how you are going to do it. 4) No metrics Conversely, it might be tempting to add specific targets or metrics to your focus areas - avoid this. Metrics will absolutely come into play for your plan, but not at this stage. Keep things high level for now, but still outcome focused. Need extra inspiration to write your focus areas? Check out this list of the most popular templates in our strategy library, pre-filled with examples that will help kickstart your strategic planning process.¬† Key focus areas In truth, when we distill the various focus areas of clients we work within Cascade , we can surmise that the vast majority fit into one of the following broad business objective categories. If you're struggling for inspiration , think about which of the following categories you want your organization to focus on and start creating strategic focus areas from there: Expansion / Growth - e.g. Expand network to the Asia Pacific Revenue / Cost / Margin - e.g. Increase sales Customer Satisfaction - e.g. Repeat business from customers Compliance - e.g. Zero regulatory issues Innovation - e.g. Launch new product lines Engagement with a Stakeholder Group - e.g. Engage with our community Employee Happiness - e.g. Proud & Happy Staff You may well create strategic focus areas that don't fit into any of the categories above, but hopefully, this list gives you a good starting point. The methodology is not dissimilar from ones such as the Balanced Scorecard and most other strategic frameworks for that matter. Linking focus areas to your vision statement & values The key outcome that we're trying to achieve when creating strategic focus areas, is to realize our Vision Statement . Ask yourself, if you succeed on each of your focus areas, will you realize your Vision in full? If your gut tells you 'no' - then you've got a couple of options. Either revisit your focus areas or revisit your vision statement. Either approach is valid - one of the key rules around creating our vision statement was to incorporate an element of pragmatism (not too much though!). If your focus areas encompass the entirety of what you think your organization can realistically achieve (even with any growth that forms part of your plan), and they still won't realize your vision - don't be afraid to go back a couple of steps and make some tweaks. When it comes to aligning our strategic focus areas to our company values , this is equally important albeit for a different reason. Well written company values should encompass our desired organizational culture. Area of focus examples Our culture is the environment, or if you prefer the enabler for our activities. There are no hard and fast rules about how company values and focus areas should fit together - but a couple of obvious examples might be: (Value) Energy - [Focus Area] Expand our business internationally (Value) Empathy - [Focus Area] Responding to Customer Feedback (Value) Continuous Learning - [Focus Area] Staff Training & Empowerment In much the same way as for your Vision and Values - we would strongly encourage you to involve your key team members in the process of creating strategic focus areas. As always, the more involved people are in the creation process, the more empowered they will be to deliver them. There are many ways to do this, from running Focus Groups, issuing Surveys and simply being responsive to ideas and suggestions as they come up as part of business-as-usual. However, nothing beats a culture of open and honest communication where such discussions occur naturally as a result of people's pride and passion for the organization. Share this post\n",
