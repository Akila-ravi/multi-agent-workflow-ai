# Multi-Agent AI Workflow System

This project is about using **multiple AI agents** to work together and complete tasks automatically. It is built using **CrewAI**, **LangChain**, and **OpenAI**.

## Tools Used

- Python
- CrewAI
- LangChain
- OpenAI GPT

##  What It Does

- Different AI agents do different parts of a task.
- They share information and work together like a team.
- Can be used to generate reports, answer questions, or do research.

## Files

- `AI__AGENT__PROJECT.ipynb` – Main notebook with the code

## ▶How to Run

1. Install libraries:
   
   pip install crewai langchain openai
2. This project uses OpenAI API (GPT-4).  
   You need a valid API key to use the model.  
   [Note: API key is not included in this shared project.]

3. Open the notebook (`AI__AGENT__PROJECT.ipynb`) in Jupyter or Google Colab.

4. Run each cell to see how agents collaborate.
